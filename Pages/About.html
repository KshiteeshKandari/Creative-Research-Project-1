            How is the growth of AI and Algorithms affecting the jobs that are related to driving in the market today? Would these jobs become obsolete in the future?

I want to represent the work with the idea of city tour in mind. We will travel across the city going through checkpoints and learning about the automation present in different sectors related to driving.
I want the project to have an isometric game art, where at every check point we can see a p5 sketch related to that specific field. As we travel around the city we learn about these jobs that get affected. 

The intention of this research topic is to educate the public about jobs related to driving that are being affected because of AI. Future planning in this AI driven society is important and should be exercised and revised at least once every 5 years.



The research would require scholarly articles on:
•	Involvement of Automated systems in driving.
•	The effectiveness of these automated systems.
•	The capabilities of the automated systems.
•	Algorithms used in self driving cars.
•	How it is affecting the jobs right now Vs how it will be affected in the future
•	Some kind of census regarding peoples opinion on automated systems in driving.
•	Generation of new job from this take over.
Some of the resources that I would be using are:

  Linehan, Murphy, G., Hicks, K., Gerling, K., & Morrissey, K. (2019). Handing over the Keys: A Qualitative Study of the Experience of Automation in Driving. International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 35(18), 1681–1692. https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2019.1565482

  Venturi, & Korda, K. (2020). Hands-on vision and behavior for self-driving cars : explore visual perception, lane detection, and object classification with Python 3 and OpenCV 4 (1st edition). Packt.

  Güvenç. (2022). Autonomous road vehicle path planning and tracking control. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
The game plan for finding more resources is using knowledge obtained from these resources to explore further on certain topics. I have been using UIC Library Database for these resources and plan on doing that for the entirety of research.
The research question has changed from the original draft which has made me change the idea for Sketches to use as well. The different P5 sketches would include different job fields related to driving.
•	A p5 sketch that would showcase delivery systems with automated driving.
•	A sketch with automated taxi services
•	A sketch to showcase automated public transport
•	A sketch to show graphs of involvement of automated cars in the society over the years.
