            How is the growth of AI and Algorithms affecting the jobs that are related to driving in the market today? Would these jobs become obsolete in the future?

I want to represent the work with the idea of city tour in mind. We will travel across the city going through checkpoints and learning about the automation present in different sectors related to driving.
I want the project to have an isometric game art, where at every check point we can see a p5 sketch related to that specific field. As we travel around the city we learn about these jobs that get affected. 

The intention of this research topic is to educate the public about jobs related to driving that are being affected because of AI. Future planning in this AI driven society is important and should be exercised and revised at least once every 5 years.
