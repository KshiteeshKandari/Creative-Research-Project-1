            How is the growth of AI and Algorithms affecting the jobs that are related to driving in the market today? Would these jobs become obsolete in the future?

<br>
I want to represent the work with the visual novel/mini game in mind. We will go through Gon's journey to get to his dad while learning about the automation present in different sectors related to driving.
I want the project to a old visual novel game narrative, where we continue with gon's journey while hitting obstacles and learning about the reality that we might see in the future 
<br><br>
The intention of this research topic is to educate the public about jobs related to driving that are being affected because of AI. Future planning in this AI driven society is important and should be exercised and revised at least once every 5 years.
